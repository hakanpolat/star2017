In this article it is explained how the machine can be affected 
when it is integrated. Then during the introduction it is explained how
the shape will be ( circular and the power electronics in a ring shape.).

Having a high power density and fault tolerance is essential for aerospace industry.

-System integration ( combining motor and power electronics) 
1) reduces weight and volume

2) If the loss density is kept constant the temperature will increase.


EMI filter: Filters the electromagnetic disturtion from the lines.


??? We give a 540 VDC but we are sending it to phases. Does full bridge generate oscillation.???


In a permanent magnet design it is harder to control the excitation. Therefore it is less fault 
tolerant.
In case of fault the H field of the magnets may cause unwanted current at the windings 
which may lead to higher current and aging of the system.
